Since the task requires modifying the button element on the homepage, we need to locate the button in the `Base` component and make the necessary changes there. However, the provided code only imports and renders the `Base` component, and we don't have access to the `Base` component's code. 

In this case, we cannot make any changes to the provided `src/pages/index.tsx` file. You should locate the `Base` component file and make the necessary changes there, following the proposed solution steps.
