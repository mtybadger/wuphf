```python
# Function to replace a string in a file
def replace_string(file_path, old_string, new_string):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_data = file.read()

    file_data = file_data.replace(old_string, new_string)

    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(file_data)

# Function to replace words in a file
def replace_words(file_path, old_words, new_words):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_data = file.read()

    for old_word, new_word in zip(old_words, new_words):
        file_data = file_data.replace(old_word, new_word)

    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(file_data)

# Replace "Wuphf" with "Meaow.ai"
replace_string('README.md', 'Wuphf', 'Meaow.ai')

# Replace dog-related words with cat-related words
dog_words = ["dog", "puppy", "canine", "pooch"]
cat_words = ["cat", "kitten", "feline", "tabby"]
replace_words('README.md', dog_words, cat_words)

# Note: Replacing dog images with cat images is not possible in a .md file.
# This would require updating the image sources in HTML files or renaming the image files themselves.
```

The updated code includes the functions to replace strings and words in the given file. The dog-related words are replaced with cat-related words, and "Wuphf" is replaced with "Meaow.ai". However, replacing images is not possible in a .md file, so that part of the task is not applicable here.
